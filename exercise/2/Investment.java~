/*1. Create a program that calculates how much a $14,000 investment would be

 * in value the second year, and increased 12% in the third year. 

40% = .40 = decimal format

2. Write a program that displays two numbers and uses the / and % operators 
to dis- play the result and remainder after they are divided. Use the \t 
character escape code to separate the result and remainder in your output. */
